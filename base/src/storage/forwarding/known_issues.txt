- Issue: Template Withdrawals
  Due to the design of the collector, the plugin is unable to remove old
  templates and send template withdrawals to connected destinations, when
  a source of flows (i.e. an exporter) is disconnected.
  The plugin doesn't get information about source disconnection. Current
  implementation is almost prepared for receiving information about disconnected
  clients, but support from the collector is required.
