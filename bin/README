Instructions on tcp rewriting your capture files:
NOTE: You cannot send packets from the same machine to the same machine, you 
	MUST use a different machine to send packets to your target

1.  Take the capture file and convert it to a convertable format
	tcprewrite --infile=<pcap> --outfile=<pcap>.1 --dlt=enet

2.  Convert all the Destination IP and MAC addresses to your target
	tcprewrite --infile=<pcap>.1 --outfile=<pcap>.2 --dstipmap=0.0.0.0/0:x.x.x.x --enet-dmac=yy.yy.yy.yy.yy.yy
	where x.x.x.x is the IP address of where you want to send your packets
	yy.yy.yy.yy.yy.yy is the MAC Address of where you want to send your packets
	Note: use "ipconfig -a" to find both

3.  Probably optional, but you can Convert the SOURCE IP's and MAC with the following.  You 
	MAY NOT WANT TO DO THIS as it will make ipfixcol think that ALL PACKETS are coming
	from the same router.  This is a valid thing, a single exporting router can have 
	multiple entities sending templates and packets....
	UNLESS you need to get through firewalls or something, you PROBABLY SHOULD NOT DO THIS STEP
	tcprewrite --infile=<pcap>.2 --outfile=<pcap>.3 srcipmap=0.0.0.0/0:y.y.y.y --enet-smac=zz.zz.zz.zz.zz.zz
	where y.y.y.y is the IP Address of where you are sending from
	zz.zz.zz.zz.zz is the MAC Address of where you are sending from

4.  Fix the checksums
	tcprewrite --infile=<pcap>.3 --outfile=<pcap>.final --fixcsum

5.  SHIP IT!
	sudo tcpreplay --intf1=<eth> --pps=<#> <pcap>.final
	where <eth> is the interface you want to ship out your packets on
	<#> is how fast you want to send the packets, remove this option if you want to 
		send them at the same speed you received them
